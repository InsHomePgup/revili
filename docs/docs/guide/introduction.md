## Introduce

`Revili` is a command and GUI integration tool based on `Vite`, which can also be referred to as a Cli tool for quickly assembling Cli tool.

`Revili` combines a series of related capabilities into a capability set through `Kit`, and each kit is independent of each other. Therefore, the original intention of `Revili` is to enable web front-end developers to crystallize their experience and ideas into standardized capabilities (development kits) and share these capabilities (publish kits).

The capabilities contained in a Kit are divided into two parts: custom commands and GUI. The two are independent and do not rely on each other, allowing users to only develop one of them based on their habits. At the same time, they can also serve as different manifestations of the same functionality, allowing users to choose the way they use based on their habits or interests.
